## About Me

Hello world! I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) co-advised by Professor [Robert M. Freund](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/rfreund/) and Professor [Bart Van Parys](https://www.vanparys.xyz/). 

My research focuses on developing efficient algorithms for large-scale optimization and machine learning. I have recently worked on [BnB-PEP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07305), which is the first unified methodology to construct optimal first-order algorithms for convex and nonconvex optimization.

I obtained my M.A.Sc. (GPA 4.00/4.00) from the [ECE Department,](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2016. After that, I worked as a researcher at the Research & Technology Department of [Thales Canada](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/americas/canada) for almost three years. My [M.A.Sc. research work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261516304830) on optimization models to compute energy-efficient railway timetables has been integrated with the largest installed base of communication based train control systems worldwide. Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](http://www.buet.ac.bd/).

## Upcoming

I will be giving a long talk on “Design and analysis of first-order methods via nonconvex QCQP frameworks” at the [$1^\text{st}$ Workshop on Performance Estimation Problems](https://performanceestimation.github.io/PEP-talks/february_2023/program.html)  taking place from February 13-14, 2023 at UCLouvain, Belgium.
