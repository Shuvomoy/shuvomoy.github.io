## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) advised by Professor [Robert M. Freund](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/rfreund/) and Professor [Bart Van Parys](https://www.vanparys.xyz/). 

My research is primarily in optimization—both theory and computation—and often both simultaneously. I have been developing [methodologies](https://shuvomoy.github.io/Papers/Das_Gupta_et_al_BnB_PEP.pdf) that automate the construction of *provably fastest* algorithms for classes of optimization problems, including many of those arising in machine learning, business analytics, and data science more broadly. These methodologies formulate algorithm design and analysis as solvable optimization problems in and of themselves, which has led to several significant and impactful applications, such as  [discovering optimal algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15704) and [constructing novel mathematical proofs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01530.pdf). In addition to my research in theory and computational tools in optimization, I have been working on developing sustainable transportation systems, and my research in this area has been [implemented](https://shuvomoy.github.io/Papers/A_two_step_linear_programming_model_for_energy_efficient_timetables_in_metro_railway_networks.pdf) in the largest installed base of communication-based train control systems worldwide.

I obtained my M.A.Sc. from the [ECE Department,](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2016. After that, I worked as a researcher at the Research & Technology Department of [Thales Group](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en) for almost three years. Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](http://www.buet.ac.bd/).
