## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu/), [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), hosted by Professor [Christian Kroer](https://www.columbia.edu/~ck2945/) and Professor [Garud Iyengar](https://www.columbia.edu/~gi10/). I recently obtained my Ph.D. from the [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) in May 2024. My research is primarily in optimization—both theory and application—and often both simultaneously. 

**Update.** I will join the [Department of Computational Applied Mathematics & Operations Research](https://cmor.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) as an Assistant Professor starting July 2025. 

## News

* Our [BnB-PEP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07305) paper is a finalist for the 2024 George Nicholson Student Paper Competition!

* I have received the 2024 Informs Computing Society Student Paper Award for the [BnB-PEP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07305) paper! [[citation](/assets/Awards/Shuvomoy_INFORMS_Computing_Society_ICS_student_paper_prize_citation.pdf)]

* Recently our [OptISTA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15704) algorithm, discovered using [BnB-PEP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07305), has been successfully applied to solve large-scale magnetization transfer imaging problems by a group at [NYU School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu/) (see the [Imaging Neuroscience paper by Assländer et al](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00177/120855)) and has been incorporated into their [open-source software package](https://github.com/JakobAsslaender/MRIgeneralizedBloch.jl)!
