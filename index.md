## About Me

Hello world! I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) advised by Professor [Robert M. Freund](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/rfreund/) and Professor [Bart Van Parys](https://www.vanparys.xyz/). 

I am broadly interested in developing efficient algorithms for large-scale optimization and machine learning problems. In particular, I have proposed  [a unified methodology for constructing provably fastest algorithms](https://shuvomoy.github.io/Papers/Das_Gupta_et_al_BnB_PEP.pdf) for optimization and machine learning, where I have demonstrated that the problem of finding the fastest algorithm is itself equivalent to solving another practically tractable optimization problem. I have proposed and implemented an efficient algorithm (open source implementation [here](https://github.com/Shuvomoy/BnB-PEP-code)) to solve this optimization problem to certifiable global optimality, with its optimal solution representing the fastest algorithm. I have found applications of this methodology in constructing [novel mathematical proofs for widely used algorithms lacking such results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01530) and discovering [provably optimal algorithms for constrained optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15704). Currently, I am applying ideas from this methodology to an ongoing industry project aimed at developing sustainable transportation systems. This project builds on my research on energy-efficient railway timetabling, which has already been [implemented in the largest installed base of communication-based train control systems worldwide](https://shuvomoy.github.io/Papers/A_two_step_linear_programming_model_for_energy_efficient_timetables_in_metro_railway_networks.pdf).

I obtained my M.A.Sc. (GPA 4.00/4.00) from the [ECE Department,](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2016. After that, I worked as a researcher at the Research & Technology Department of [Thales Canada](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/americas/canada) for almost three years. Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](http://www.buet.ac.bd/).
