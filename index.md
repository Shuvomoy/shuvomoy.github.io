## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) advised by Professor [Robert M. Freund](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/rfreund/) and Professor [Bart Van Parys](https://www.vanparys.xyz/). 

I am interested in developing efficient algorithms for operations research, machine learning, and business analytics. I have proposed [a unified methodology to construct the fastest algorithms](https://shuvomoy.github.io/Papers/Das_Gupta_et_al_BnB_PEP.pdf) for large-scale optimization and machine learning, where I have shown that finding the fastest algorithm is equivalent to solving a practically tractable optimization problem. I have proposed and implemented an efficient algorithm (open-source implementation [here](https://github.com/Shuvomoy/BnB-PEP-code)) to solve this optimization problem, with its solution representing the fastest algorithm. My approach has found applications in [discovering faster algorithms](https://www.quantamagazine.org/risky-giant-steps-can-solve-optimization-problems-faster-20230811/), [constructing novel mathematical proofs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01530.pdf), and developing sustainable transportation systems, building on my research in energy-efficient railway scheduling [implemented in industry](https://shuvomoy.github.io/Papers/A_two_step_linear_programming_model_for_energy_efficient_timetables_in_metro_railway_networks.pdf).

I obtained my M.A.Sc. from the [ECE Department,](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2016. After that, I worked as a researcher at the Research & Technology Department of [Thales Group](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en) for almost three years. Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](http://www.buet.ac.bd/).

## News

* In a recent article (available [here](https://www.quantamagazine.org/risky-giant-steps-can-solve-optimization-problems-faster-20230811/)), [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/about/) interviewed and quoted me about our [BnB-PEP](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-023-01973-1) paper, which inspired the discovery of [long step gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06324.pdf) by [Prof. Ben Grimmer](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~grimmer/)! 

* I gave a talk about my work on “A Robust Data-driven Linear Programming Model for Minimizing Energy Consumption in Metro Railway Networks” at [POMS 2023](https://pomsmeetings.org/conf-2023/).
